## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m TJ Homrich.

   ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an Information Systems Specialist with a passion for all things technology!! I have 5 years of professional experience supporting a long host of software and hardware in a healthcare environment. I've been passionate about all things electronic since I was a kid taking apart our home PC (Woohoo, 256MB of RAM!!) and that has continued to develop into learning further complex ideals such as creating a Linux web server, building multiple PCs since then, and more.
   
   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Github, Salesforce, MySQL, PHP, and more I can't even list!
